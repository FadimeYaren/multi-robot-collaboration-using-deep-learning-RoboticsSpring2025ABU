01frozenlake.py: Agent should reach to prize without fall the holes.

02frozenlake.py: This is same with 01 and there is a heatmap, if agent reaches to 
prize it means one episode completed, heatmap will be updated.

03frozenlake.py: Here, the agent learns how to reach the goal in a 4x4 FrozenLake 
map by trial and error. The Q-table stores the expected reward for every 
state-action pair. During training, we visualize the learning progress using a heatmap. 
After training, the agent successfully navigates the environment using the learned optimal 
policy.
